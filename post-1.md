Beyond Earth, we think about whether life could exist on any other planet. However, one of the only planets that could possibly have any chance would be Mars. Nobody has set foot on Mars just yet; however, we have transported rovers and landers. The only other place beyond Earth people have been to has been the Moon. The moon's still pretty far. 

Don't you wonder why it's not so easy to get to other planets? Why are there other planets, but no life like humans? What goes beyond our galaxy, is there another galaxy where life exists? Why is Earth the only planet with the sun and moon? How are all these planets just floating in space with nothing supporting it? 

These are all things to think about when looking at space.
